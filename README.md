![](Images/IMG_2092.png)

## Project Description 

Monsoon is a Max for Live granular sampler combined with MIDI control through a touch screen and knobs. The controller is connected through a Teensy 4.0 and uses the adafruit TouchScreen library and the teensyduino IDE. 

Final project for New Electronic Instrument Design (EP-390) at Berklee College of Music.

## Parameters and Controls

The touch screen is the main source of control, the x-axis determines the sample position, and the y-axis controls the sample length. 

The knobs control the grain position range, the grain duration range, and the looping speed which is linked to the session's tempo.
